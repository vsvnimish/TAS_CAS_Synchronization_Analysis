Note: inp-params.txt and remaining three files should be in same folder 

execution for TAS program:
         command to execute: g++ -pthread SrcAssgn3-tas-CS19B1026.cpp -o p
                           : ./p<inp-params.txt>TAS-ME-Output.txt

after execution of this commands file named "TAS-ME-Output.txt" will be generated in same folder

execution for CAS program:
         command to execute: g++ -pthread SrcAssgn3-cas-CS19B1026.cpp -o g
                           : ./g<inp-params.txt>CAS-ME-Output.txt

after execution of this commands file named "CAS-ME-Output.txt" will be generated in same folder

execution for CAS-bounded program:
         command to execute: g++ -pthread SrcAssgn3-cas-bounded-CS19B1026.cpp -o j
                           : ./j<inp-params.txt>Bounded-CAS-ME-Output.txt

after execution of this commands file named "Bounded-CAS-ME-Output.txt" will be generated in same folder
